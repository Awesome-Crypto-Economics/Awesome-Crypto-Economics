# Awesome-Crypto-Economics


**Welcome Aboard the Crypto World**

What's Cryptoeconomics?


Some of our friends say Cryptoeconomics approaches combine Cryptography and Economics, but it can not explain the entire of Cryptoeconomics. While we received too many infomations, that make us confused. So we attempt to build a project for arrange more knowlege in this area, we believe under the teamwork in the project, we can establish a clear and useful path for our beautiful Crypto future.

Every sigle part in Cryptoeconomics is meaningful for our technology improvement. For example, without the asymmetric cryptography, we can't achieve a better P2P network. There's more possibilities waiting for our disclose, and here's how to participate in this Project.

Brief

To achieve a well-development crypto economy, we need lots of factor. And Cryptography is the most important factor for the entire industry. The most important thing in the blockchain is the Trust, and the trust is from the algorithm, so that we can bring something important thing to the blockchain.

Thats the reason we always say: "Don't Trust, Verify"

<h3 id="13">Consensus</h3>

Brief

Before the blockchain technology, we use Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) on distributed computing systems, and we have Practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) at 1999, which provides high-performance Byzantine state machine replication, processing thousands of requests per second with sub-millisecond increases in latency.

One example of BFT in use is bitcoin, a peer-to-peer digital cash system. The bitcoin network works in parallel to generate a blockchain with proof-of-work allowing the system to overcome Byzantine failures and reach a coherent global view of the system's state.

And that is the Consensus when we have a coherent global state in one system. There's more than one way to reach consensus, such like PoW/PoS/DPoS, no matter what kind of ways, we use encryption algorithm to protect the procedure.

<h3 id="20">Adoption</h3>

Brief

This is the early stage for crypto industry. Base on blockchain 1.0/2.0, more possiblities are coming, with more government trying to adopt and recognize this improvement. There's still some obstacles on the way, sometimes we compromise, sometimes we have to build a bridge, and here's some info for you to understand the difficulties currently.
