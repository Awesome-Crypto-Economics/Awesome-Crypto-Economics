**Welcome Aboard the Crypto World**

What's Cryptoeconomics?


Some of our friends say Cryptoeconomics approaches combine Cryptography and Economics, but it can not explain the entire of Cryptoeconomics. While we received too many infomations, that make us confused. So we attempt to build a project for arrange more knowlege in this area, we believe under the teamwork in the project, we can establish a clear and useful path for our beautiful Crypto future.

Every sigle part in Cryptoeconomics is meaningful for our technology improvement. For example, without the asymmetric cryptography, we can't achieve a better P2P network. There's more possibilities waiting for our disclose, and here's how to participate in this Project.
