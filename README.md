We attempt to build a project for explore more knowlege in this area, we believe under the teamwork in the project, we can establish a clear and useful path for our beautiful Crypto future.

Every sigle part in the cryptoeconomics is meaningful for our technology improvement. For example, without the asymmetric cryptography, we can't achieve a better P2P network. There's more possible waiting for our disclose, and here's how to participate in this Project.
